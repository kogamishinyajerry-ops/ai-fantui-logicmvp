# State

Last activity: 2026-04-09 - P3 control-plane hardening now auto-retires superseded legacy review artifacts after an approved gate, refreshes 09C on successful runs, and kept the loop green with 150 tests OK.

## Current Position

- Round 92 is complete and regression-protected with 150 tests OK in the latest local verification.
- Notion control tower is live at https://www.notion.so/AI-FANTUI-LogicMVP-33cc68942bed8136b5c9f9ba5b4b44ec.
- GitHub repo is live at https://github.com/kogamishinyajerry-ops/ai-fantui-logicmvp.
- P1 is closed as Approved in the Review Gate after GitHub-backed Opus adjudication.
- The two historical `Automation failure: P1-01 ...` gaps are now resolved as superseded by later successful runs.
- 09C now functions as a state-driven current Opus review brief, not a fixed prompt template.
- Local runs, GitHub Actions, and Notion writeback now share a single validation entrypoint via `tools/run_gsd_validation_suite.py`.
- 09C now explicitly distinguishes between “需要 Opus 审查” and “当前无需 Opus 审查”, and a normal refresh no longer overwrites an already approved gate decision.
- Review snapshots now prefer GitHub Action run / QA evidence over local Codex runs, so current Opus briefs stay anchored to the GitHub evidence plane.
- The shared validation suite now emits stable `python3 ...` command labels instead of machine-local Python executable paths.
- The GitHub workflow now runs Node24-compatible action versions and opts into `FORCE_JAVASCRIPT_ACTIONS_TO_NODE24=true`, matching GitHub's current deprecation path for JavaScript actions.
- The shared validation suite now also checks live Notion control-plane accessibility, validating the configured key pages and databases before a drift reaches Opus review time.
- Successful non-gated writebacks now refresh 09C automatically, so the current Opus brief keeps following the latest validated plan without a separate maintenance step.
- The old `P1 自动化目标审查 Gate` and `P1-02 消除手动浏览器 QA 依赖` records are now treated as configured legacy review artifacts and auto-archived once the approved default gate confirms no review is currently required.

## Active Objective

Keep the development loop operational and reduce avoidable manual cleanup:

- Write Execution Run records to Notion.
- Write QA records to Notion.
- Create UAT Gap records on failure.
- Route subjective human review through Opus 4.6 Review Gate only.
- Ensure Opus 4.6 review briefs cite Notion pages and the GitHub repo only.
- Automatically supersede same-plan legacy gaps after later successful runs.
- Keep the current review brief generator aligned with the live Notion control-tower structure and GitHub evidence URLs.
- Retire superseded legacy review artifacts automatically after the approved default gate settles into a no-review-needed state.

## Blockers/Concerns

- `NOTION_API_KEY` is visible locally.
- GitHub credentials live in `~/.zshrc`, so non-interactive shells may need explicit sourcing or env injection.
- Opus 4.6 review packets must never rely on local terminal file paths.
- Historical browser hand-check notes in archived coordination docs are not part of the active review contract.
