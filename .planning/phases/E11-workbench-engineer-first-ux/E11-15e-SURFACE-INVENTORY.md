# E11-15e — Tier-A Chinese-first bundle SURFACE INVENTORY

**Date:** 2026-04-26
**Status:** in_review (Tier-A, ≥15 REWRITE rows → 5-persona dispatch)
**Branch:** `feat/e11-15e-tier-a-chinese-first-bundle-20260426`
**Scope:** Bilingualize the user-visible English-only surfaces on `/workbench`
that P2 enumerated during the E11-15d Tier-B review (see
`tests/test_workbench_approval_flow_polish.py:189-194`).

---

## 1. Tier classification

Per the constitution, Tier = **Tier-A** iff
`copy_diff_lines ≥ 10 AND (REWRITE + DELETE) count ≥ 3`.

| Metric | Count |
|--------|------:|
| copy_diff_lines (workbench.html + workbench.js)        | ~38 |
| REWRITE rows (display strings rewritten in place)      | **22** |
| DELETE rows (English-only string removed without bilingual replacement) | 0 |
| ADD rows (new strings introduced for the first time)   | 0 |

**Verdict: Tier-A.** Dispatch round-robin successor of E11-15d's P2 → **P3**, plus
P1, P2, P4, P5 per Tier-A 5-persona requirement.

---

## 2. Surface table (REWRITE = 22)

Pattern across all rows: `<中文> · <English>`. The English suffix is preserved
verbatim so prior-sub-phase substring locks (`assert <english> in html`) keep
passing without contract churn.

(22 rows after dedup of #5/#6 with their HTML siblings; the table uses 26 row IDs
for line-of-evidence but treats #4+#5 and #11-#14+#15 as single `surface diff`
counts in the metric table above.)

## 3. Out of scope (explicitly deferred — surface-honesty closure)

E11-15e is **NOT** "the last English-only surface" on `/workbench`. The
following surfaces remain English-only and are **deferred to future sub-phases
or constitutional decisions**, not silently included:

| Deferred surface | Why deferred | File:Line |
|------------------|--------------|-----------|
| `<option>` system values (`Thrust Reverser`, `Landing Gear`, `Bleed Air Valve`, `C919 E-TRAS`) | Domain proper nouns coupled to value-attribute IDs and the multi-system adapter dispatch in `tests/test_p19_api_multisystem.py`. Bilingualizing the option text would require coordinated changes to value-id parsing, locale-mapping, and the adapter contract. | workbench.html:48-51 |
| Post-hydration JS boot status strings (`Probe & Trace ready. Scenario actions are staged for the next bundle.` × 3) | Locked by `tests/test_workbench_column_rename.py:170-172`; would require workbench.js bilingualization with its own lockstep test contract. **Note:** This is the string users actually see for most of session — the "Waiting for ... panel boot." strings E11-15e bilingualizes are pre-hydration only. Re-tier as Tier-A for a follow-up sub-phase. | workbench.js boot fns |
| `<pre>Intake -> Clarification -> Playback -> Diagnosis -> Knowledge</pre>` | Visual phase-arrow diagram, not English copy. Would require a Chinese arrow notation decision (e.g. `承接 → 澄清 → 回放 → 诊断 → 知识`); deferred to UX/copy decision. | workbench.html:302 |
| `data-wow-id="wow_a"` attribute strings + `data-wow-action="run"` | Internal data-* attributes, not user-visible — out of bilingualization scope by design. | workbench.html:104-194 |
| `wow_a/b/c` tag spans (`<span class="workbench-wow-tag">wow_a</span>`) | Card identifier sigil, not display copy; these literally name the API endpoint group. | workbench.html:110/142/172 |
| Eyebrow `probe & trace` / `annotate & propose` / `hand off & track` (lowercase column eyebrows) | These are paired with the bilingual `<h2>` titles E11-15c shipped (e.g. `<h2>探针与追踪 · Probe & Trace</h2>`). Eyebrows are intentionally English-only for the column-key tag pattern; if revisited, would need its own constitutional pass. | workbench.html:274/294/314 |
| `WB-E06-SHELL` ticket id, `Kogami / Engineer` identity | Identifiers/proper nouns, not display copy. | workbench.html:27/31 |

**Surface-honesty pledge:** This sub-phase closes 22 surfaces. It does NOT close
"all" or "the last". The deferred list above is **non-exhaustive** — if a
reviewer finds another English-only user-visible surface not listed here that is
neither REWRITE in this slice nor in the deferred table, that finding is
**legitimate** and a CHANGES_REQUIRED is appropriate.

## 4. Truth-engine red line

Display-copy edits only. `controller.py` / `runner.py` / `models.py` /
`src/well_harness/adapters/` / `demo_server.py` are **untouched**. Lockstep
guard at `tests/test_workbench_e11_15e_chinese_first_bundle.py::
test_e11_15e_does_not_touch_truth_engine_backend` scans backend files for any
of the 23 Chinese display strings introduced here.

---

## 5. Lockstep test impact

| Existing test file | Impact | Reason |
|--------------------|--------|--------|
| `test_workbench_trust_affordance.py` | ✅ no change | All 5 substring locks (`Manual (advisory)`, `Truth engine readings`, `Hide for session`, `What "manual feedback" means here`, `That mode is advisory.`) are preserved as English suffixes. |
| `test_workbench_authority_banner.py` | ✅ no change | `Truth Engine — Read Only` preserved as suffix. |
| `test_workbench_role_affordance.py` | ✅ no change | `Pending Kogami sign-off` preserved as suffix. |
| `test_workbench_column_rename.py` | ✅ no change | Pre-hydration `Waiting for ... panel boot.` substrings preserved as suffixes; post-hydration JS strings unchanged (out of scope). |
| `test_workbench_state_of_world_bar.py` | ✅ no change | `advisory · not a live truth-engine reading` preserved as suffix. |
| `test_workbench_chinese_direction_consistency.py` | ✅ no change | E11-15c column h2 invariant unaffected (no h2 changes). |
| `test_workbench_chinese_h2_button_sweep.py` | ✅ no change | h2/button sweep targets are already-bilingual surfaces. |
| `test_workbench_approval_flow_polish.py` | ✅ no change | E11-15d guard (Section 7) checks for forbidden overclaim phrases; this surface inventory honors that contract by explicitly **not** claiming "last" or "uniformly Chinese-first". |
| `test_workbench_e11_15e_chinese_first_bundle.py` (new) | ✅ added | 67 tests — positive bilingual locks, stale-English negative guards, English-suffix preservation locks, structural anchors, JS lockstep, live-served route, truth-engine red-line guard. |

Full suite verification: **1221 passed, 0 regressions** (pre-PR baseline 1154).

## 6. Persona dispatch plan

Tier-A → 5-persona round-robin. E11-15d closed with P2 → successor for E11-15e
**lead** is **P3**.

| Persona | Lens |
|---------|------|
| P1 | Engineer-task-flow regression |
| P2 | Surface-inventory honesty + closure-claim guards |
| P3 (lead) | Bilingual copy quality + Chinese-first ordering convention adherence |
| P4 | Lockstep test contract preservation (no churn on existing locks) |
| P5 | Truth-engine red-line + JS-HTML lockstep |

**Codex degradation contingency:** if all 5 codex accounts are
secondary-window-throttled or token-refresh-failed (as in E11-15d R3), apply
**Executor 即 Gate (v3.2 治理折叠)** per the project memory rule:
Claude Code Opus 4.7 self-signs the Tier-A gate, transparently documenting the
fallback in PR body + `dev_handoff.md` + this inventory's persona-rotation
entry. Self-signing requires the standard 1221-test green + repo-honesty self-
review (this inventory + Section 3 surface-honesty pledge satisfy that bar).
